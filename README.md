## Installation Instructions 

 To install and deploy this code, you can use the deploy_script.sh script. Keep in mind that you have to have a Amazon Linux server with dependencies installed in it. We will provide a backup of the server in order for you to use. We have also created the image of the server using its current status. In the future, you can use this image to work with the website.
